# CW9-Threading
J. Kenneth Wallace

## Design Notes:
- I did the first bonus and added a simple timer that increments every second (integer timer, no decimals)
- Timer is useless below 8 digits
- At 8 digits (99999999 darts and 3 threads) my computer takes 2 seconds
- At 9 digits (999999999 darts and 3 threads) my computer takes 24 seconds (see Capture.PNG)
- Im sure there is a way to optimize the calculations, or maybe i just need a better CPU.
